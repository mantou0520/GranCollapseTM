# gran_collapse_unfinished
This code is used to calculate the dynamics of granular materials during the collapse of granular columns. I name it as unfinished because I haven't finished adding cubes in this code. There is still something wrong with this code. It should be noted that, when using models with cubic particles, this code can be compiled and ran, but the result isn't quite rignt.
